SpaceDash is an app that will provide information on all the present past and future Launches and Vehicles of SpaceX. Currently, the app is in developement. I am following Test-Driven Agile Development for this app. The future scope of this app includes an AR view of various vehicles of SpaceX, and event updates from even more Space Agencies!
